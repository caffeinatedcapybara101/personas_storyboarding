            <h3> Accessible Interface </h3>
            <p>
                I chose to examine the Snackpass order kiosk at Ten One Tea House in order to understand
                how and why users interact with this product.
            </p>

            <p>
                The kiosk at Ten One allows for contactless ordering of drinks and helps with reducing the
                wait time for ordering. It consists of a screen that allows customers to choose their drinks
                and a stand with a card reader. When customers first arrive, the home screen contains a "Tap
                to Continue" caption that informs users to tap anywhere on the screen to continue with the
                ordering process:

            </div>
            <p>
                Once customers tap the screen, they are met with a new interface that displays the menu.
                The menu contains information about the different categories of drinks, the names of each
                drink, the price of the drink, images of the drink, etc.
            </p>
            <div class="figures">
                <img src="images/kiosk_menu.jpg" alt="kiosk menu page">
            </div>
            <p>
                Once the customer taps on the drink they want to order, they are presented with options about
                how they want their drink and other add-ons.
                The options are spilt into categories (size, milk, milk foam,
                toppings, ice level, and sugar level). If the category is required, then it ensures that users
                select an options. Additionally, if certain options within a category cost extra money, the
                screen will disply exactly how much will be added to the total.
            </p>
            <div class="figures">

            </div>
            <p>
                After users have selected all their add-ons, they can either add more drinks or check out. On
                the checkout page, the users are able to see every item they have in their cart (along with
                any choices/add-ons they selected) and the total price of their order.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Finally, when customers place the order, they are presented with a screen informing them how to
                make the payment. From here, they can use the card reader attached to the kiok in order to pay.
                This card reader allows for cards (insert or tap to pay) as well as Apple Pay.
